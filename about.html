    <h2>About me</h2>

    Since you're here, let's be clear: I work to make a living, not the other way around. My "living" necessarily includes my musical obsessions. Step in and have a look, maybe you'll find something you like. There is no specific order in the list, which is regularly (and a bit randomly) updated.

    <p>Seatbelts (1998) Cowboy Bebop, especially the Bad Dog no Biscuits theme. Curiously, one of the best bebop records was composed for a TV show! Which, by the way, is simply great.</p>

    <p>Have you ever heard Alicia de Larrocha playing Granados? This 1990 compilation basically made my COVID lockdown. I would listen to it 4-5 times every week. For months. This Albeniz Compilation (1992) is also fantastic. And this Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain too. In short, she was outstanding.</p>

    <p>Keith Jarret (1975) The Köln Concert (Paolo Brunori is especially proud for having discovered this record for me). The Trios are very cool as well.</p>

    <p>Floating Points and Pharoah Sanders (2021) Promises. I believe it is one of the very last records by Pharoah. Only if you are in the mood for spiritual jazz, in a sort of Coltraine-type meditation.</p>

    <p>Mahler Symphonies. There are many great versions around but I would list these as my favourites: 1st, 3rd, 5th, 9th, PLUS Das Lied von der Erde.</p>

    <p>Shostakovich Symphonies. Like Mahler, these are just my favourite versions: 5th, 10th, (did you know the second movement is inspired in Stalin?!) and 11th.</p>

    <p>Gato Barbieri (1972) Last Tango in Paris. I know it's a bit commercial, so what?</p>

    <p>Also, the Piano Concerto n1 by Benjamin Britten (1945 revised -anad much better- version). Not so many records that I could find, this is very good.</p>

    <p>Listen to the Pre-Performance remarks on Glenn Gould by The Maestro. Then enjoy the Concerto for Piano and Orchestra nº1 by Brahms. I guess you know Gould, so try to convince me that the 1955/56 Goldberg Variations are better than the 1981.</p>

    <p>If you are reading these before or after Easter times, just play the Harnoncourt (2001) Bach St Matthew Passion.</p>

    <p>Likewise, before Christmas, one should always listen at least once the Handel Messiah. Matter of personal taste, but the Sir Andrew Colins version is just superb. If you are in a hurry, find here a 75 minutes selection.</p>

    <p>Bach Cantatas can be tough. With Gardiner, they are not so. Especially this 140 & 147 record (the 4th, Chorale, "Zion hört die Wächten singen", takes you somewhere). And 170, of course.</p>

    <p>I understand if you feel that the Wagner Ring is just too much for you. But maybe that is because you have never heard the Maazel (1988) The Ring Without Words. If you like it, then you may enjoy the Chéreau/Boulez 1980 Ring production in Bayreuth. It is namely the best production I have seen. And, if (and only if) you want to become a Wagner geek like myself, just go for the Alex Ross Wagnerism.</p>

    <p>TOOL (2019) Fear Inoculum. Danny Carey is, IMHO, the most talented drummer at the moment.</p>

    <p>Furtwängler (1942) Beethoven 9th. You have probably heard this piece many times, but you may have never listened to this version. Check the date and read the description of the video. Breathtaking.</p>

    <p>Time for some "Rock Andaluz". Pioneros (2016) is a nice set for those not quite familiar with these tunes that mix rock, flamenco and arab vibes. If you like it dig into Triana, Alameda or Derby Motoreta Burrito Cachimba to learn more about this fantastic genre. The Gardener also has very cool stuff.</p>

    <p>Now that we are at it. Maybe you are curious about flamenco, but do not speak Spanish and have no clue where to start. Be aware, this is just a shallow selection and a beginner's guide, and there is a thousand ways to do this:</p>

    <p>If you are more into instrumental flamenco, try Siroco (1987, Paco de Lucía), Entre Dos Aguas (1981, Paco de Lucía), Almoraima (1976, Paco de Lucía, pay attention to Río Ancho), this Compilation of Tomatito (2010) and Orobroy (1998, Dorantes). All of them, but Orobroy, are guitar (and percusion, and other stuff). Orobroy is piano.</p>

    <p>It is impossible to understand Spanish music and instrumental flamenco without Bacarisse's Romanza. Here is a very nice version. I must confess I find it a bit cheesy, but it is undeniable that the cadence of the guitar and the strings are a fundamental milestone in our musical heritage. It has been imitated 100 times, and I bet there are many more to come.</p>

    <p>This is not exactly "Flamenco", but since it is Paco de Lucía it makes sense to have the Concierto de Aranjuez (1992) here.</p>

    <p>If you want to go also for singing stuff, try Omega, by Enrique Morente (1996). A set of poems by Lorca and Leonard Cohen, on a post-jazz fashion. Probably top 5 in Flamenco History (I am happy to defend this on a martial court). If you like this Enrique Morente guy, then Aunque es de noche (1984, is super popular and even Rosalía has her own version), Lorca (1999), and Nueva York - Granada (1990). As you see, the man was simply amazing.</p>

    <p>La leyenda del Tiempo (1979) is arguably the best record in Spanish ever. Not talking about Flamenco, but in general. For any spanyard insterested in music is a milestone, but if you come from abroad you may not know it. I'd suggest you to try and find a translation of the lyrics, although I could not find a decent one...</p>

    <p>If you like this guy, Soy Gitano (1989), this Live in Paris (1987) and this Live in the Montreux Jazz Festival (1991) are excellent. Dig a bit more into the several discs he recorded with Paco de Lucía.</p>

    <p>Other Flamenco stuff, maybe a fresher style for some: Aire (1998, José Mercé), Encuentro (1985, El Lebrijano), Oripandó (2022, José Mercé), and Diverso (Miguel Poveda, 2022). Finally: I find Idas y las Vueltas (2014, Arcángel) to be very special. It mixes medieval arab-castillian tunes with a Flamenco air. Really something to listen with some time ahead.</p>

    <p>You may be thinking "come on man, this is all very old-fashioned stuff, all records are from 30 years ago". Well, my intention was to show the basics, classic stuff that has survived time -which is always a good sign-. But I got the point. So:</p>

    <p>Israel Fernández is a very pure, traditional, absolutely excellent flamenco singer. His last records are amazing: Por amor al cante (2024) and Pura Sangre (2023).</p>

    <p>IMHO El Niño de Elche is at the moment *the* voice and character to follow in the Flamenco world. I say this because Yerai Cortés and his Guitarra Flamenca (2024) is a bit cliché, isnt it?. This Antología (2018), with the monumental Prefacio, or Flamenco. Mausoleo de Celebración, Amor y Muerte (2022) and Cante a lo Gitano (2024) are good proofs of it.</p>

    <p>But Sangre Sucia (by Ángeles Toledano) was obviously the best record in 2024.</p>

    <p>Calle Pureza by Rubio de Pruna may be the best in 2025.</p>

    <p>Not the best voice, and I reckon there's a lot of fantastic marketing, but I reckon the AMORIOS, LA VERDAD DE MI COPLILLA by La Tania is crushing the Spotify at home in the early 2025.</p>

    <p>Let´s come back to jazz. No order here, you see. Coleman Hawkins (1963) Hawkins! Alive! At the Village Gate. Just listen the second track, and then tell me if you manage not to listen the whole record.</p>

    <p>Arianna Savall (2017) gave us this strange piece named The Wind Rose a few years ago. I don't think I have fully understood it, but quite often I see myself back to it. Arianna is the daughter of Jordi Savall and Montserrat Figuras. If you dont know who they are just google their names right now! Explore the Hesperion XXI project and Jordi's discography. Latelly, I have been quite obsessed with Mare Nostrum (2012).</p>

    <p>Kodály (1992) Galanta Dances. Had the chance to discover these dances in Budapest, and really felt in love. These Hungarians really dance.</p>

    <p>If you like modern and soft jazz ensembles, Lars Danielsson could be for you. Check the Cloudland (2021) and Summerwind (2018).</p>

    <p>If you live in London I guess you know the Nest Sessions by The Tucans in The NinetyOne. Try the Nest Sessions (2024)and Libre (2020).</p>

    <p>Not super into videogames but from time to time I like to spend a few hours on that. Some have fantastic scores and music compilations too. Please, try this list with the Braid Soundtrack.</p>

    <p>You may know Ryuichi Sakamoto, who sadly left us a couple of years ago. There are a couple of wonderful documentaries about his art: Opus (2023) and Coda (2017). His OSTs, like the scores for The Revenant (2015), The Last Emperor (1987) or Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence (1983) are History already. Some other pieces, like those in 1996 (maybe in this 2011 version) just can't be missed.</p>

    <p>Now that we are in the Murakami mood let me fit the Drive My Car (2021) score, by Eiko Ishibashi. Quite different, but you can also try the Dave Brubeck Quartet (1964) Jazz Impressions of Japan.</p>

    <p>Avishai Cohen has some of the best jazz records in the past years: Shifting Sands (2022), Aurora (2009) and Two Roses (2021) to name a few. I believe he Tours around Europe every year. Just stay tuned and go to see him, is really an experience.</p>
